# nvim-setup

My custom Neovim setup

# Installation

Download in your config directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pml68/nvim-setup ~/.config/nvim

After starting Neovim, and letting Lazy and nvim-treesitter install everything, run the `:MasonInstallAll` command to install the required LSPs and formatters
